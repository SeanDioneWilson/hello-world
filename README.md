# hello-world
test repository for learning
Hello, this is my first time using github. I plan to use it for a  set of goals i've committed to. 
90 projects in 180 days posted on here that will lead me to gaining the skills and knowledge
required to landing my first software development job. 
I started a blog about it earlier today at developerseanwilson.wordpress.com
